# React + TypeScript + Vite Shadcn Table Real Pagination

This template provides a minimal setup to paginate Shadcn data table.
Shadcn ui implements a client side pagination in thier data table example which is useless in terms of performance,
this is an implementation of real pagination while keeping the data-table as a reusable compenent.

`note that this project is just to demonstrate the data-table don't follow any other practices because it is far from good.`
